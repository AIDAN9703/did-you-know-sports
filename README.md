## Getting Started

This project is built with a modern full-stack architecture using FastAPI and React. Follow the setup instructions below to get the application running locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- Docker and Docker Compose (for database and development)
- Git

### Configure

You can then update configs in the `.env` files to customize your configurations.

Before deploying it, make sure you change at least the values for:

- `SECRET_KEY`
- `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

You can (and should) pass these as environment variables from secrets.

Read the [deployment.md](./deployment.md) docs for more details.

### Generate Secret Keys

Some environment variables in the `.env` file have a default value of `changethis`.

You have to change them with a secret key, to generate secret keys you can run the following command:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

Copy the content and use that as password / secret key. And run that again to generate another secure key.

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:AIDAN9703/did-you-know-sports.git
   cd did-you-know-sports
   ```

2. **Start the development environment:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
